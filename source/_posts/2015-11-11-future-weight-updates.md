As per the request of my TermiTrainer, Jake, there will be less-frequent weight status updates in the sidebar. He wants me to only check once a week, on Monday morning. This is because throughout a given week, your weight will fluctuate depending on food/water in your body, etc. Checking it daily is essentially micromanaging it.

So here's to not only making progress, but also much more noticeable gains at a time.
